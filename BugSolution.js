This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has fully mounted. This often happens inside lifecycle methods like `constructor` or before `componentDidMount` has completed. The solution is to ensure that any access to state or props happens after the component has mounted.  Use `componentDidMount` or conditional rendering to check for existence.
